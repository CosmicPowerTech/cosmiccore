## Installation

To install Cosmic Core into your application, simply download the `cosmiccore` directory and place it in the same directory as your Python file. After this, to use it, just import the module(s) you want to use with Python's built-in import function.

For instance, if you want to use the functionalities of Cosmic Basics, you would write the following code:

```python
from cosmiccore.cosmicbasics import *
```

Starting with v0.3.0, you can also write this if you want to use all Cosmic Core functionalities:

```python
from cosmiccore import *
```
